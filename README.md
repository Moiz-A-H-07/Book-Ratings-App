the app of book recommendation
The scan button is in the wireless-lib file which I will compare it with the form to make the scan work properly. In form there are the buttons of the scan and search and also the author and the book input box. when we scan the QR code of the book it will give you a link that will tell you about the Book. the rest of the code is for entering the name of author and book for search when there is no QR code to scan. Thank You.
